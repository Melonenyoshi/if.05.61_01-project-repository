## Aim
The given repository shall be used by your team throughout the whole project to store all necessary project artifacts.

## Repository Structure
The repository shall follow the structure as given below, i.e., the top level directories should be according to the following naming scheme:

```
01_ProjectPlanning
02_Requirements
03_SourceCode
04_Testing
05_ReleaseDocs
06_MeetingMinutes
07_Templates
08_MiscDocs
```

## Directories' Content
Despite of the folders which content is very clear from its name the content of the folders should be

1. `01_ProjectPlanning`: Effort estimations, schedules, sprint backlogs, product burndown, ...
1. `02_Requirements`: System specification and related documents, product backlog.
1. `05_ReleaseDocs`: All documents to accompany a release of your product like feature lists, change logs, open issues, final test report, ...
1. `06_MeetingMinutes`: Notes, decisions, and action items taken during meetings.
1. `08_MiscDocs`: Project proposal, Design documents, general customer info, everything not fitting into any other directory given above.

## Use of the Directory `07_Templates`
In this directory a number of different ready made templates are given which will have to be used throughout the project.

During the school year the necessary input how to use the templates is given and you will get a hint which template to use next.

As usual when working with a template the original file residing in `07_Templates` is copied to the proper location and the concrete topic is added there. E.g., the template for the project proposal is copied to the directory `08_MiscDocs`, then the template explanation text is deleted from the copied document and the actual text of your project proposal is added.

## Tools
Although we also provide doc, pages, or odt templates, preferably you should use LaTeX to get used to this tool.
